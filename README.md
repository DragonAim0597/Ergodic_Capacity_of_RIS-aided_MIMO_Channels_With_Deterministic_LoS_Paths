# Ergodic_Capacity_of_RIS-aided_MIMO_Channels_With_Deterministic_LoS_Paths
This repository includes part of simulation codes of the paper "On the Ergodic Capacity of RIS-aided MIMO Channels With Deterministic Line-of-Sight Paths".\\
The file 'Nt_Nr_ECC_Bounds.m' can be utilized to calculate the bounds and asymptotic capacity for the case Nt>Nr.\\
The file 'Nr_Nt_ECC_Bounds.m' can be utilized to calculate the bounds and asymptotic capacity for the case Nt<=Nr.\\
